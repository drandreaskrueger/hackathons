## polkadot hackathon / gitcoin - BUGS
### bug 1: cannot submit

>  "Unable to fulfill bounty. Please try again later"

Which is NOT a helpful error message.

Much later, via the discord chat, I found out that the FORM has a bug, and fractions of an hour (e.g. 0.5) are not allowed.

When using "1" hours, I did NOT get the same error message.

So I suppose, my work is submitted now?

How would I know now?

Oh yes, patience - I have now waited approx 1 hour, is that perhaps not long enough???


### bug 2: no user feedback whatsoever
*Have I submitted?*  
*Have I not submitted?*   

**How would I know that?**

The [dashboard](https://gitcoin.co/dashboard) still has the "Submit work" button enabled for each of my challenges, as if I have to still submit my work.

But then when trying that, the same error message again:

>  "Unable to fulfill bounty. Please try again later"

Which is not only not helpful, but really ... wrong.

(Only) Using the console, I found this error message:

> "raven.js:58 error: bounty fulfillment failed with status: 400 and message: error: user can submit once per bounty"

That looks as if I HAVE submitted my work.

#### Suggestion:

What about using the section on the [dashboard](https://gitcoin.co/dashboard) which says "0 Work Submitted".
It says "You don't have any submission awaiting payment" 

What if you let it express instead: "You have submitted 2 pieces of work".

Wouldn't that be nice?
